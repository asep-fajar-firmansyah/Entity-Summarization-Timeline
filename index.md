# Entity Summarization

## Shortly brief of entity summarization

Based on the distributed RDF dataset statistics, more than 10.000 datasets are following Semantic Web standards. 
It provides a billion triples (RDF data) that are used by many applications to provide information to the human. 
Avoiding information overload on the data consumers [[1]](#1) and making it more concise and recapitulative [[2]](#2) are some reasons used by researchers to conduct research on Entity Summarization. 
Entity summarization is a technique to establish short summary (of) RDF data [[2]](#2)[[3]](#3) so that users are able to identify the underlying identity quickly [[3]](#3). 
Comparing to document summarization where the data is unstructured and there are many frequent words, entity summarization works on RDF that is structured and without frequent terms. 
Many researchers have been conducted researches on individual entity to produce entity summaries.
